# v0.2.2

Versions v0.2.x must keep being source compatible with Pyjamas.

* Update to DLang frontend 2.090
* Autogeneration of GH Pages with documentation
* Rewrite tests to use Silly
* Fixed false positives with should.exists . The old aproach to see if is convertible to null, wasn't working.
* Improved the test battery to detect false positives.
* Documenting the source code, so ddoc can generate the documentation.
